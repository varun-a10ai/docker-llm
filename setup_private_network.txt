You need to edit the following file: `/etc/netplan/xx-cloud-init.yaml`
If the server was attached to the VPC at creation, this may not be needed. If not, you must make the file match the following

```
network:
  ethernets:
    enp157s0f0:
      critical: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac
      dhcp4: true
      nameservers:
        addresses:
        - <THE PUBLIC IP OF THE SERVER>
    enp157s0f1:
      routes:
      - to: 172.16.0.0/12
        via: 10.40.0.3
      - to: 10.32.0.0/16
        via: 10.40.0.3
      dhcp4: true
      addresses: [10.40.0.XX/16]
  ```

  where you update the 10.40.0.XX/16 part and swap XX for the private IP of the server

  When finished, run `sudo netplan apply` to apply the changes

  NOTE: You may need to adjust interface names if they don't match the actual interfaces attached
